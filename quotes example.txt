*Book: Blood Meridian
*P: 4-5
*Tags: child, humanity, wilderness, nature, transformation
*Notes: McCarthy seems here to be commenting on all of humanity, as he seems to be doing with the story of the kid in general. And this is as well a statement of the purpose of the book - to explore this question as to whether or not one’s heart, one’s nature, can be transformed through will.
Only now is the child finally divested of all that he has been. His origins are become remove as his his destiny and not again in all the world’s turning will there be terrains so wild and barbarous to try whether the stuff of creation may be shaped to man’s will or whether his own heart is not another kind of clay.

*P: 20
*Tags: God, creation, individuality
The way of the transgressor is hard. God made the world, but he didnt make it to suit everybody, did he?
*Tags: notion, nature, mind, knowing, self-knowing, God, evil, humanity, Satan, machine
…where does a man come by his notions. What world’s he seen that he liked better?… A man’s at odds to know his mind cause his mind is aught he has to know it with. He can know his heart, but he dont want to. Rightly so. Best not to look in there. It aint the heart of a creature that is bound in the way that God has set for it. You can find meanness in the least of creatures, but when God made man the devil was at his elbow. A creature that can do anything. Make a machine. And a machine to make the machine. And evil that can run itself a thousand years, no need to tend it.

*P: 43
*Tags: God, God’s wrath, hell
The wrath of God lies sleeping. It was hid a million years before men were and only men have power to wake it. Hell aint half full.

*Book: Skin in the Game
*P: 4
*Tags: opinion, morality, obligation, consequences, skin in the game
If you give an opinion, and someone follows it, you are morally obligated to be, yourself, exposed to its consequences.

*P: 5
*Tags: explanation, justification, principle
*Notes: Taleb doesn’t justify this at all. Extensive justification may be unnecessary, but beyond that, why would it be undesirable?
Never engage in detailed overexplanations of why something important is important: one debases a principle by endlessly justifying it.

*P: 7
*Tags: skin in the game, reality, exposure, risk, contact
*Notes: This seems to align with the pragmatic theory of truth.
The contact with the real world is done via skin in the game — having exposure to the real world, and paying a price for its consequences, good or bad.

*P: 8
*Tags: knowledge, trial and error, experience, time, contact, skin in the game
*Notes: Skin in the game taught us that the world was flat and orbited by the heavenly bodies. Reasoning taught us that that was not the case. Granted, skin in the game likely would eventually have gotten us to the right answer about the topography of the cosmos, but at the time we didn’t have the technology to do so and may never have — or it may have been much delayed — without the knowledge we gain through reason.
The knowledge we get by tinkering, via trial and error, experience, and the workings of time, in other words, contact with the earth, is vastly superior to that obtained through reasoning, something self-serving institutions have been very busy hiding from us.

*P: 9
*Tags: interventionism, dynamics, dimensions, actions, interactions, complexity
*Notes: These are things that Taleb supports later on. With regards to dimensions, it’s essentially a matter of graph theory. Adding one node to a network even with only hundreds of notes can add millions of connections, increasing the complexity of the graph in a nonlinear fashion. 
[The] three flaws [of the ‘interventionistas’]: 1) they think in statics not dynamics, 2) they think in low, not high, dimensions, 3) they think in terms of actions, never interactions.

*P: 10
*Tags: systems, complexity, uncertainty, risk, outcome
*Notes: We usually have an idea of the potential outcomes, or at least think we do.
…one should not mess with a system if the results are fraught with uncertainty, or, more generally, should avoid engaging in an action with a big downside if one has no idea of the outcomes.

*Tags: decisions, risk, skin in the game
…those who don’t take risks should never be involved in making decisions.

*P: 12
*Tags: bureaucracy, consequences, skin in the game
Bureaucracy is a construction by which a person is conveniently separated from the consequences of his or her actions.

*P: 13
*Tags: government, big government, skin in the game
*Notes: Taleb gives the specific example of bailouts, but does not prove the general case.
Government interference in general tends to remove skin in the game.

*P: 14
*Tags: modernity, humanity
*Notes: I agree that this is the case, but Taleb doesn’t prove it or explain why this is a consequence of modernity in particular.
The curse of modernity is that we are increasingly populated by a class of people who are better at explaining that understanding or better at explaining than doing.

*P: 15
*Tags: systems, learning, via negativa
*Notes: Cf. Popper
Systems learn by removing parts, via negativa. (Via negativa: the principle that we know what is wrong with more clarity than what is right, and that knowledge grows by subtraction).

*P: 20
*Tags: first amendment, freedom of speech, constitution, symmetry
*Notes: A dig at the Left and the policy of de-platforming. Taleb elsewhere acknowledges Popper’s paradox of tolerance but doesn’t apply it here. 
The very idea behind the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States is to establish a silver rule-style symmetry: you can practice your freedom of religion so long as you allow me to practice mine; you have the right to contradict me so long as I have the right to contradict you. Effectively, there is no democracy without such an unconditional symmetry in the rights to express yourself, and the gravest threat is the slippery slope in the attempts to limit speech on grounds that some of it may hurt people’s feelings. Such restrictions do not necessarily come from the state itself, rather from the forceful establishment of an intellectual monoculture by an overactive thought police in the media and cultural life.
