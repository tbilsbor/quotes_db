0,Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,2,"schizophrenia, psychoanalysis",A schizophrenic out for a walk is a better model than a neurotic lying on the analyst’s couch.
1,Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,2,"nature, Bataille","Lenz has projected himself back to a time before the man-nature dichotomy, before all the co-ordinates based on this fundamental dichotomy have been laid down."
2,Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,3,"schizophrenia, nature, individuality, process, production, humanity, society","What the schizophrenic experiences, both as an individual and as a member of the human species, is not at all any one specific aspect of nature, but nature as a process of production."
3,Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,xii,"desire, politics, meta",(Michel Foucault in Preface) How can and must desire deploy its forces within the political domain and grow more intense in the process of overturning the established order?
4,Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,xiii,"anti-Oedipal, culture, meta","(Michel Foucault in Preface) [B]eing anti-oedipal has become a life style, a way of thinking and living."
5,Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,xiii,"fascism, action, politics, individualism, de-individualization","(Michel Foucault in Preface) This art of living counter to all forms of fascism, whether already present or impending, carries with it a certain number of essential principles which I would summarize as follows if I were to make this great book into a manual or guide to everyday life: …Develop action, thought and desires by proliferation, juxtaposition, and disjunction, and not by subdivision and pyramidal hierarchization… Prefer what is positive and multiple, difference over uniformity, flows over unities, mobile arrangements over systems… Do not demand of politics that it restore the “rights” of the individual, as philosophy has defined them. The individual is the product of power. What is needed is to “de-individualize” by means of multiplication and displacement, diverse combinations. The group must not be the organic bond uniting hierarchized individuals, but a constant generator of de-individualization."
6,Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,xvi,"meta, anti-Oedipal, Nietzsche, Christianity, herd","(Mark Seem in Introduction) In confronting and finally overturning the Oedipal rock on which Man has chosen to take his stand, Anti-Oedipus comes as a kind of sequel to another similar venture, the attack on Christ, Christianity, and the herd in Nietzsche’s The Antichrist."
7,Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,xvi-xvii,"Nietzsche, ressentiment, self, individualism","(Mark Seem in Introduction) The man of ressentiment, as Nietzsche explains… is prompted by an instinct of self-affirmation and self-preservation that cares little about preserving or affirming life, an instinct “in which every lie is sanctified.”"
8,Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,xvii,"meta, flow, oscillation, body without organs, schizophrenia, desire","(Mark Seem in Introduction) From paranoia to schizophrenia, from fascism to revolution, from breakdowns to breakthroughs, what is investigated is the process of life flows as they oscillate from one extreme to the other, on a scale of intensity that goes from 0 (“I never asked to be born… leave me in peace”), the body without organs, to the nth power (“I am all that exists, all the names in history”), the schizophrenic process of desire."
9,Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,xx,"individuality, existentialism, humanity, will, transformation","(Mark Seem in Introduction) [Deleuze and Gauttari] urge mankind to strip itself of all anthropomorphic and anthropological armoring, all myth and tragedy, and all existentialism, in order to perceive what is nonhuman in man, his will and his forces, his transformations and mutations."
