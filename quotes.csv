0,Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,2,"schizophrenia, psychoanalysis",A schizophrenic out for a walk is a better model than a neurotic lying on the analyst’s couch.,
1,Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,2,"nature, Bataille","Lenz has projected himself back to a time before the man-nature dichotomy, before all the co-ordinates based on this fundamental dichotomy have been laid down.",
2,Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,3,"schizophrenia, nature, individuality, process, production, humanity, society","What the schizophrenic experiences, both as an individual and as a member of the human species, is not at all any one specific aspect of nature, but nature as a process of production.",
3,Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,xii,"desire, politics, meta",(Michel Foucault in Preface) How can and must desire deploy its forces within the political domain and grow more intense in the process of overturning the established order?,
4,Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,xiii,"anti-Oedipal, culture, meta","(Michel Foucault in Preface) [B]eing anti-oedipal has become a life style, a way of thinking and living.",
5,Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,xiii,"fascism, action, politics, individualism, de-individualization","(Michel Foucault in Preface) This art of living counter to all forms of fascism, whether already present or impending, carries with it a certain number of essential principles which I would summarize as follows if I were to make this great book into a manual or guide to everyday life: …Develop action, thought and desires by proliferation, juxtaposition, and disjunction, and not by subdivision and pyramidal hierarchization… Prefer what is positive and multiple, difference over uniformity, flows over unities, mobile arrangements over systems… Do not demand of politics that it restore the “rights” of the individual, as philosophy has defined them. The individual is the product of power. What is needed is to “de-individualize” by means of multiplication and displacement, diverse combinations. The group must not be the organic bond uniting hierarchized individuals, but a constant generator of de-individualization.",
6,Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,xvi,"meta, anti-Oedipal, Nietzsche, Christianity, herd","(Mark Seem in Introduction) In confronting and finally overturning the Oedipal rock on which Man has chosen to take his stand, Anti-Oedipus comes as a kind of sequel to another similar venture, the attack on Christ, Christianity, and the herd in Nietzsche’s The Antichrist.",
7,Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,xvi-xvii,"Nietzsche, ressentiment, self, individualism","(Mark Seem in Introduction) The man of ressentiment, as Nietzsche explains… is prompted by an instinct of self-affirmation and self-preservation that cares little about preserving or affirming life, an instinct “in which every lie is sanctified.”",
8,Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,xvii,"meta, flow, oscillation, body without organs, schizophrenia, desire","(Mark Seem in Introduction) From paranoia to schizophrenia, from fascism to revolution, from breakdowns to breakthroughs, what is investigated is the process of life flows as they oscillate from one extreme to the other, on a scale of intensity that goes from 0 (“I never asked to be born… leave me in peace”), the body without organs, to the nth power (“I am all that exists, all the names in history”), the schizophrenic process of desire.",
9,Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,xx,"individuality, existentialism, humanity, will, transformation","(Mark Seem in Introduction) [Deleuze and Gauttari] urge mankind to strip itself of all anthropomorphic and anthropological armoring, all myth and tragedy, and all existentialism, in order to perceive what is nonhuman in man, his will and his forces, his transformations and mutations.",
10,Blood Meridian,4-5,"child, humanity, wilderness, nature, transformation",Only now is the child finally divested of all that he has been. His origins are become remove as his his destiny and not again in all the world’s turning will there be terrains so wild and barbarous to try whether the stuff of creation may be shaped to man’s will or whether his own heart is not another kind of clay.,"McCarthy seems here to be commenting on all of humanity, as he seems to be doing with the story of the kid in general. And this is as well a statement of the purpose of the book - to explore this question as to whether or not one’s heart, one’s nature, can be transformed through will."
11,Blood Meridian,20,"God, creation, individuality","The way of the transgressor is hard. God made the world, but he didnt make it to suit everybody, did he?",
12,Blood Meridian,20,"notion, nature, mind, knowing, self-knowing, God, evil, humanity, Satan, machine","…where does a man come by his notions. What world’s he seen that he liked better?… A man’s at odds to know his mind cause his mind is aught he has to know it with. He can know his heart, but he dont want to. Rightly so. Best not to look in there. It aint the heart of a creature that is bound in the way that God has set for it. You can find meanness in the least of creatures, but when God made man the devil was at his elbow. A creature that can do anything. Make a machine. And a machine to make the machine. And evil that can run itself a thousand years, no need to tend it.",
13,Blood Meridian,43,"God, God’s wrath, hell",The wrath of God lies sleeping. It was hid a million years before men were and only men have power to wake it. Hell aint half full.,
14,Skin in the Game,4,"opinion, morality, obligation, consequences, skin in the game","If you give an opinion, and someone follows it, you are morally obligated to be, yourself, exposed to its consequences.",
15,Skin in the Game,5,"explanation, justification, principle",Never engage in detailed overexplanations of why something important is important: one debases a principle by endlessly justifying it.,"Taleb doesn’t justify this at all. Extensive justification may be unnecessary, but beyond that, why would it be undesirable?"
16,Skin in the Game,7,"skin in the game, reality, exposure, risk, contact","The contact with the real world is done via skin in the game — having exposure to the real world, and paying a price for its consequences, good or bad.",This seems to align with the pragmatic theory of truth.
17,Skin in the Game,8,"knowledge, trial and error, experience, time, contact, skin in the game","The knowledge we get by tinkering, via trial and error, experience, and the workings of time, in other words, contact with the earth, is vastly superior to that obtained through reasoning, something self-serving institutions have been very busy hiding from us.","Skin in the game taught us that the world was flat and orbited by the heavenly bodies. Reasoning taught us that that was not the case. Granted, skin in the game likely would eventually have gotten us to the right answer about the topography of the cosmos, but at the time we didn’t have the technology to do so and may never have — or it may have been much delayed — without the knowledge we gain through reason."
18,Skin in the Game,9,"interventionism, dynamics, dimensions, actions, interactions, complexity","[The] three flaws [of the ‘interventionistas’]: 1) they think in statics not dynamics, 2) they think in low, not high, dimensions, 3) they think in terms of actions, never interactions.","These are things that Taleb supports later on. With regards to dimensions, it’s essentially a matter of graph theory. Adding one node to a network even with only hundreds of notes can add millions of connections, increasing the complexity of the graph in a nonlinear fashion. "
19,Skin in the Game,10,"systems, complexity, uncertainty, risk, outcome","…one should not mess with a system if the results are fraught with uncertainty, or, more generally, should avoid engaging in an action with a big downside if one has no idea of the outcomes.","We usually have an idea of the potential outcomes, or at least think we do."
20,Skin in the Game,10,"decisions, risk, skin in the game",…those who don’t take risks should never be involved in making decisions.,
21,Skin in the Game,12,"bureaucracy, consequences, skin in the game",Bureaucracy is a construction by which a person is conveniently separated from the consequences of his or her actions.,
22,Skin in the Game,13,"government, big government, skin in the game",Government interference in general tends to remove skin in the game.,"Taleb gives the specific example of bailouts, but does not prove the general case."
23,Skin in the Game,14,"modernity, humanity",The curse of modernity is that we are increasingly populated by a class of people who are better at explaining that understanding or better at explaining than doing.,"I agree that this is the case, but Taleb doesn’t prove it or explain why this is a consequence of modernity in particular."
24,Skin in the Game,15,"systems, learning, via negativa","Systems learn by removing parts, via negativa. (Via negativa: the principle that we know what is wrong with more clarity than what is right, and that knowledge grows by subtraction).",Cf. Popper
25,Skin in the Game,20,"first amendment, freedom of speech, constitution, symmetry","The very idea behind the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States is to establish a silver rule-style symmetry: you can practice your freedom of religion so long as you allow me to practice mine; you have the right to contradict me so long as I have the right to contradict you. Effectively, there is no democracy without such an unconditional symmetry in the rights to express yourself, and the gravest threat is the slippery slope in the attempts to limit speech on grounds that some of it may hurt people’s feelings. Such restrictions do not necessarily come from the state itself, rather from the forceful establishment of an intellectual monoculture by an overactive thought police in the media and cultural life.",A dig at the Left and the policy of de-platforming. Taleb elsewhere acknowledges Popper’s paradox of tolerance but doesn’t apply it here.
